**NeutronStar** is a distributed Graph Neural Networks (GNN) training framework that supports CPU-GPU heterogeneous computation on multiple workers. 

NeutronStar distinguishes itself from other GNN training frameworks with the following new properties:

 * The dependency management (how to acquire the embeddings and gradients from neighbors) plays a key role in distributed GNN training. NeutronStar combines the cache-based dependency management that are adopted by DGL and Aligraph and the communication-based dependency management method that are widely adopted by traditional graph computing systems, and proposes a hybrid dependency management GNN distributed training system. NeutronStar can determine the optimal way to acquire the embeddings (during forward propagation) and the gradients (during backward propagation) from neighboring vertices. 
 * NeutronStar integrates the pytorch automatic differentiation library libtorch and tensorflow to support automatic differentiation (automatic backpropagation) across workers. 
 * NeutronStar is enhanced with many optimization techniques from traditional distributed graph computing systems to effectively accelerate the performance of distributed GNN training, such as CPU-GPU I/O optimization, Ring-based Communication, Overlapping Communication with Computation, Lock-free Parallel Message Enqueuing, and so on.

The overall architecture of NeutronStar

Currently NeutronStar is under refactoring. We will release all features of NeutronStar soon.
(The optimizations and auto. diff. functions are almost finished.)
(The new DepCache engine is under progress.)



## Quick Start

First clone the repository and initialize the submodule:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iDC-NEU/NeutronStarLite.git
cd NeutronStarLite
git submodule update --init --recursive

# or just use one command
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/iDC-NEU/NeutronStarLite.git
```


A compiler supporting **OpenMP** and **C++11** features (e.g. lambda expressions, multi-threading, etc.) is required.

**cmake** >=3.14.3

**MPI** for inter-process communication 

**cuda** > 9.0 for GPU based graph operation.

**libnuma** for NUMA-aware memory allocation.

**cub** for GPU-based graph propagation


```
sudo apt install libnuma-dev"
```

**libtorch** version > 1.7 with gpu support for nn computation

unzip the **libtorch** package in the root dir of **NeutronStar** and change CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH in "CMakeList.txt"to your own path

download **cub** to the ./NeutronStar/cuda/ dictionary.


configure PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH for **cuda** and **mpi**
```
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-10.2
export MPI_HOME=/path/to/your/mpi
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CUDA_HOME/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PATH=$MPI_HOME/bin:$CUDA_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

**clang-format** is optional for auto-formatting: 
```shell
sudo apt install clang-format
```

#configure "CUDA_ENABLE" flag in ./cuda/cuda_type.h (line 20) to '1' or '0' to enable or disable GPU compilation.
If you only need a CPU-base NeutronStar
please disable **GPU compilation** with the following command at configure time:
```shell
cmake -DCUDA_ENABLE=OFF ..
```

To build:
```shell
mkdir build

cd build

cmake ..

make -j4
```


To run:

List all nodes in ./NeutronStar/hostfile for MPI communication
```
ip1
ip2
ip3
```
copy NeutronStar to all your machines(copy_all.sh and make_and_copy.sh) and run the following command in your root DIR.

single-machine multi-slots:(strongly recommand use one slot, except for debugging)
```
./run_nts.sh $slot_number $configure_file
./run_nts.sh 1 gcn_cora.cfg
```
distributed:

```
./run_nts_dist.sh $nodes_number $configure_file
./run_nts_dist.sh 2 gcn_cora.cfg
```

ENGINE TYPE:
We list serveral example in the root dir for your reference
GCN:
gcn_cora.cfg

gcn_pubmed.cfg

gcn_citeseer.cfg

gcn_reddit.cfg

gcn_reddit_full.cfg
